# Using NLP To Tailor Youtube Videos’ Description To Reach Their Intended Target Audience

## Description
Youtube is the most popular online video sharing website which maintains a list of top trending videos on the platform. Our initial questions are how trending works for individual users, and how it would allow videos from individual creators to get trending on Youtube. According to the Youtube Website, “Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on Youtube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos and shorts that a wide range of viewers would find interesting.” Some trends are predictable like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. However, we aim to investigate if refining the description of youtube videos would result in better reach for the video.

When a video is uploaded, Youtube’s algorithm attaches certain metadata to it that tells the algorithm what the video is about. One of the sources of the algorithm for this metadata is the description content creators upload with their video. Oftenly, content creators will give a brief description of their video with a link to their social media accounts. However, since most of the time the description is a very short recapture of the video that is incomprehensive, the algorithm can not clearly define the insight of the video. This gap between the actual content of the video and insufficient descriptions can result in the failure of a video to reach its intended audience. Through using the techniques of NLP, we try to create a platform where Youtubers can refine their descriptions to describe their video extensively and thus reach the audience that is looking for similar  content. This research is using Python language for data cleaning, data analysis and prediction.
